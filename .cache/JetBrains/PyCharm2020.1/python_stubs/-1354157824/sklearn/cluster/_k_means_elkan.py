def euclidean_distances(X, Y=None, Y_norm_squared=None, squared=False, X_norm_squared=None): # reliably restored by inspect
    """
    Considering the rows of X (and Y=X) as vectors, compute the
        distance matrix between each pair of vectors.
    
        For efficiency reasons, the euclidean distance between a pair of row
        vector x and y is computed as::
    
            dist(x, y) = sqrt(dot(x, x) - 2 * dot(x, y) + dot(y, y))
    
        This formulation has two advantages over other ways of computing distances.
        First, it is computationally efficient when dealing with sparse data.
        Second, if one argument varies but the other remains unchanged, then
        `dot(x, x)` and/or `dot(y, y)` can be pre-computed.
    
        However, this is not the most precise way of doing this computation, and
        the distance matrix returned by this function may not be exactly
        symmetric as required by, e.g., ``scipy.spatial.distance`` functions.
    
        Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <metrics>`.
    
        Parameters
        ----------
        X : {array-like, sparse matrix}, shape (n_samples_1, n_features)
    
        Y : {array-like, sparse matrix}, shape (n_samples_2, n_features)
    
        Y_norm_squared : array-like, shape (n_samples_2, ), optional
            Pre-computed dot-products of vectors in Y (e.g.,
            ``(Y**2).sum(axis=1)``)
            May be ignored in some cases, see the note below.
    
        squared : boolean, optional
            Return squared Euclidean distances.
    
        X_norm_squared : array-like of shape (n_samples,), optional
            Pre-computed dot-products of vectors in X (e.g.,
            ``(X**2).sum(axis=1)``)
            May be ignored in some cases, see the note below.
    
        Notes
        -----
        To achieve better accuracy, `X_norm_squared`Â and `Y_norm_squared` may be
        unused if they are passed as ``float32``.
    
        Returns
        -------
        distances : array, shape (n_samples_1, n_samples_2)
    
        Examples
        --------
        >>> from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import euclidean_distances
        >>> X = [[0, 1], [1, 1]]
        >>> # distance between rows of X
        >>> euclidean_distances(X, X)
        array([[0., 1.],
               [1., 0.]])
        >>> # get distance to origin
        >>> euclidean_distances(X, [[0, 0]])
