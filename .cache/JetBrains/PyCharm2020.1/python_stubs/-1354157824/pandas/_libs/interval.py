        Period : Represents a period of time.
    
        Notes
        -----
        The parameters `left` and `right` must be from the same type, you must be
        able to compare them and they must satisfy ``left <= right``.
    
        A closed interval (in mathematics denoted by square brackets) contains
        its endpoints, i.e. the closed interval ``[0, 5]`` is characterized by the
        conditions ``0 <= x <= 5``. This is what ``closed='both'`` stands for.
        An open interval (in mathematics denoted by parentheses) does not contain
        its endpoints, i.e. the open interval ``(0, 5)`` is characterized by the
        conditions ``0 < x < 5``. This is what ``closed='neither'`` stands for.
        Intervals can also be half-open or half-closed, i.e. ``[0, 5)`` is
        described by ``0 <= x < 5`` (``closed='left'``) and ``(0, 5]`` is
        described by ``0 < x <= 5`` (``closed='right'``).
    
        Examples
        --------
        It is possible to build Intervals of different types, like numeric ones:
    
        >>> iv = pd.Interval(left=0, right=5)
        >>> iv
        Interval(0, 5, closed='right')
    
        You can check if an element belongs to it
    
        >>> 2.5 in iv
        True
    
        You can test the bounds (``closed='right'``, so ``0 < x <= 5``):
    
        >>> 0 in iv
        False
        >>> 5 in iv
        True
        >>> 0.0001 in iv
        True
    
        Calculate its length
    
        >>> iv.length
        5
    
        You can operate with `+` and `*` over an Interval and the operation
        is applied to each of its bounds, so the result depends on the type
        of the bound elements
    
        >>> shifted_iv = iv + 3
        >>> shifted_iv
        Interval(3, 8, closed='right')
        >>> extended_iv = iv * 10.0
        >>> extended_iv
        Interval(0.0, 50.0, closed='right')
    
        To create a time interval you can use Timestamps as the bounds
    
        >>> year_2017 = pd.Interval(pd.Timestamp('2017-01-01 00:00:00'),
        ...                         pd.Timestamp('2018-01-01 00:00:00'),
        ...                         closed='left')
        >>> pd.Timestamp('2017-01-01 00:00') in year_2017
        True
        >>> year_2017.length
        Timedelta('365 days 00:00:00')
    
        And also you can create string intervals
    
        >>> volume_1 = pd.Interval('Ant', 'Dog', closed='both')
        >>> 'Bee' in volume_1
