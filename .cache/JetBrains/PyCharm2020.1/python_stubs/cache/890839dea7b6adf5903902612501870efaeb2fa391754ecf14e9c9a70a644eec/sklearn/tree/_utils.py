class WeightedMedianCalculator(object):
    """
    A class to handle calculation of the weighted median from streams of
        data. To do so, it maintains a parameter ``k`` such that the sum of the
        weights in the range [0,k) is greater than or equal to half of the total
        weight. By minimizing the value of ``k`` that fulfills this constraint,
        calculating the median is done by either taking the value of the sample
        at index ``k-1`` of ``samples`` (samples[k-1].data) or the average of
        the samples at index ``k-1`` and ``k`` of ``samples``

        initial_capacity : SIZE_t
            The initial capacity of the WeightedMedianCalculator.
    
        samples : WeightedPQueue
            Holds the samples (consisting of values and their weights) used in the
            weighted median calculation.
    
        total_weight : DOUBLE_t
            The sum of the weights of items in ``samples``. Represents the total
            weight of all samples used in the median calculation.
    
        k : SIZE_t

        sum_w_0_k : DOUBLE_t
            The sum of the weights from samples[0:k]. Used in the weighted
            median calculation; minimizing the value of ``k`` such that
            ``sum_w_0_k`` >= ``total_weight / 2`` provides a mechanism for
            calculating the median in constant time.
